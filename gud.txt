🚀 Next steps (no code — just plan)

Create a List<Student> in Main

This will hold all students while the program runs.

Implement Case 1 – Add New Student

Ask user for ID and Name.

Create a new Student object and add it to the list.

Print confirmation.

Implement Case 2 – View All Students

Loop through the list and display each student’s ID, Name, and number of courses.

Implement Case 3 – Add Subject & Marks

Ask user which student (search by ID).

Ask for Subject name, Full marks, Obtained marks.

Add that Subject to the student’s Courses list.

Implement Case 4 – Calculate Percentage

Pick a student (by ID).

Sum their ObtainedMarks and FullMarks to show overall percentage.

(Optional for later) Add save/load to JSON file so data stays when you restart the app.
